## How to establish connection

To establish the connection one must first create the 'meeting point' for all the users that want to talk.
In the starting menu choose option **Create a room [1]** and provide all the necessary information.
Now your server is ready and waiting for users to join in.

To connect choose the second option **Join a room** and again, provide what's needed.
After successfully logging in you should see a message from the server and from now on you can start chatting.
